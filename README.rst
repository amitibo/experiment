Framework for running experiments.

The `experiment` package is meant for simplifying conducting experiments by hiding
most of the "boring" boiler plate code, e.g. experiment configuration and logging.
It is based on the Traitlets_ package.

.. note::
        The `experiment` package is still in alpha state and the API is likely to change.
